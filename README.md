# Machinery Examples

Machinery examples is a collection of system descriptions taken by the machinery
tool. The main purpose is for them to help as reference data for comparison
of your own system descriptions and also as an interactive way to learn the
tool.

For more information, [visit our website](http://machinery-project.org/).

## Usage

Each type of example is grouped by category and they all live together in
a directory. Go inside the directory and follow the instructions in README.md
